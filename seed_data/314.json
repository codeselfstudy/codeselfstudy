{"title": "The Mouse on the Moon", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>\nThe moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but there is a catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out, and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been allotted a 500 m by 500 m square area, but they will possess only that area which they wall in. 251001 posts have been placed in a rectangular grid with 1 meter spacing. The wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from post to post.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the entire 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> area. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Fenwick\">Duchy of Grand Fenwick</a>, has a tighter budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.\nFor a 2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> area the\nenclosed-area/wall-length ratio is 125.<br/>\nAlthough not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better:  if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to \u03c0*250<sup>2</sup> m<sup>2</sup> and the perimeter will be \u03c0*500 m, so the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75 m and 75\u221a2 m the total area becomes 238750 m<sup>2</sup> and the perimeter becomes 1400+300\u221a2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87, which is significantly better.\n</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"p314_landgrab.gif\" src=\"project/images/p314_landgrab.gif\"/></div>\n<p>\nFind the maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.<br/>\nGive your answer rounded to 8 places behind the decimal point in the form abc.defghijk.\n</p>\n</div>"}
