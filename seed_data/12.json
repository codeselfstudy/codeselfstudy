{"title": "Highly divisible triangular number", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</p>\n<p>Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family:'courier new';\"><b>\u00a01</b>: 1<br/><b>\u00a03</b>: 1,3<br/><b>\u00a06</b>: 1,2,3,6<br/><b>10</b>: 1,2,5,10<br/><b>15</b>: 1,3,5,15<br/><b>21</b>: 1,3,7,21<br/><b>28</b>: 1,2,4,7,14,28</blockquote>\n<p>We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>\n<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>\n</div>"}
