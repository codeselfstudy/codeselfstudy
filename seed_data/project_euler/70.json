For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, \u03c6(9)=6.<br/>The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so \u03c6(1)=1. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, \u03c6(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.</p>\n<p>Find the value of <var>n</var>, 1 &lt; <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>7</sup>, for which \u03c6(<var>n</var>) is a permutation of <var>n</var> and the ratio <var>n</var>/\u03c6(<var>n</var>) produces a minimum.</p>\n</div>"
