{"body":"<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. \nEach number (question) we ask, has a <u>cost equal to the number asked</u> and we get one of three possible answers:<br/></p><ul><li> &quot;Your guess is lower than the hidden number&quot;, or</li><li> &quot;Yes, that&apos;s it!&quot;, or</li><li> &quot;Your guess is higher than the hidden number&quot;.</li></ul><p>Given the value of <var>n</var>, an <i>optimal strategy</i> minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) <u>for the worst possible case</u>. E.g.</p><p>If <var>n</var>=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number &quot;<b>2</b>&quot;. The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).</p><p>If <var>n</var>=8, we might decide to use a &quot;binary search&quot; type of strategy: Our first question would be &quot;<b>4</b>&quot; and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions.<br/>\nLet our second question be &quot;<b>6</b>&quot;. If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.<br/>\nThus, our third question will be &quot;<b>7</b>&quot; and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=<span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>17</b></span>.</p><p>We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for <var>n</var>=8, by asking &quot;<b>5</b>&quot; as our first question.<br/>\nIf we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be &quot;<b>7</b>&quot;, then we&apos;ll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=<span style=\"color:#3333FF;\"><b>12</b></span>).<br/>\nIf we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be &quot;<b>3</b>&quot; and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be &quot;<b>1</b>&quot;, giving a total cost of 5+3+1=<span style=\"color:#3333FF;\"><b>9</b></span>.<br/>\nSince <span style=\"color:#3333FF;\"><b>12</b></span>&gt;<span style=\"color:#3333FF;\"><b>9</b></span>, the worst-case cost for this strategy is <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>12</b></span>. That&apos;s better than what we achieved previously with the &quot;binary search&quot; strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.<br/>\nSo, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for <var>n</var>=8.</p><p>Let C(<var>n</var>) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for <var>n</var>, as described above.<br/>\nThus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.<br/>\nSimilarly, C(100) = 400 and $\\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{100} {C(n)} = 17575$.</p><p>Find $\\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{200000} {C(n)}$ .</p>","id":"328","title":"Lowest-cost Search","url":"https://projecteuler.net/problem=328"}
