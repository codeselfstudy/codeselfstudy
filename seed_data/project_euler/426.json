{"body":"<p>\nConsider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.\n</p><p>\nA turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty box to its right.\n</p><p>\nAfter one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied box.\n</p><div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p426_baxball1.gif\" alt=\"p426_baxball1.gif\"/></div><p>\nA system like this is called a <b>Box-Ball System</b> or <b>BBS</b> for short.\n</p><p>\nIt can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of <b>occupied boxes</b> evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.\n</p><div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p426_baxball2.gif\" alt=\"p426_baxball2.gif\"/></div><p>\nWe define the sequence {<var>t</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>}:<br/></p><ul><li><var>s</var><sub>0</sub> = 290797\n</li><li><var>s</var><sub><var>k</var>+1</sub> = <var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub><sup>2</sup> mod 50515093\n</li><li><var>t</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> = (<var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> mod 64) + 1\n</li></ul><p>\nStarting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10</sub>), the final state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].<br/>\nStarting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10 000 000</sub>), find the final state.<br/>\nGive as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final state.
