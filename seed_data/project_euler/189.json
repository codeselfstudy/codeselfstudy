{"title": "Tri-colouring a triangular grid", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"project/images/p189_grid.gif\"/></div>\n<p>We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.<br/>\nNote: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.</p>\n<p>For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"project/images/p189_colours.gif\"/></div>\n<p>A colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered <i>distinct</i> from C unless the two are identical.</p>\n<p>How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?</p>\n</div>"}
