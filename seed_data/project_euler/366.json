So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving 2. The second player can take the two remaining stones and wins.<br/>\nSo 5 is a losing position for the first player.<br/>\nFor some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first player.<br/>\nE.g. when n=17 the first player can remove one or four stones.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet M(n) be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a winning position <i>at his first turn</i> and M(n)=0 for any other position.\n</p>\n<p>\n\u2211M(n) for n\u2264100 is 728.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind  \u2211M(n) for n\u226410<sup>18</sup>.\nGive your answer modulo 10<sup>8</sup>.\n</p>\n</div>"
