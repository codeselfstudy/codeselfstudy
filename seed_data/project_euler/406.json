{"body":"<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. \nEach number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:<br/></p><ul><li> &quot;Your guess is lower than the hidden number&quot; (and you incur a cost of <var>a</var>), or</li><li> &quot;Your guess is higher than the hidden number&quot; (and you incur a cost of <var>b</var>), or</li><li> &quot;Yes, that&apos;s it!&quot; (and the game ends).</li></ul><p>Given the value of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>, an <i>optimal strategy</i> minimizes the total cost <u>for the worst possible case</u>.</p><p>For example, if <var>n</var> = 5, <var>a</var> = 2, and <var>b</var> = 3, then we may begin by asking &quot;<b>2</b>&quot; as our first question.</p><p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that &quot;<b>1</b>&quot; is the hidden number (for a total cost of <span style=\"color:#3333ff;\"><b>3</b></span>).<br/>\nIf we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then our next question will be &quot;<b>4</b>&quot;.<br/>\nIf we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that &quot;<b>3</b>&quot; is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=<span style=\"color:#3333ff;\"><b>5</b></span>).<br/>\nIf we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then we are sure that &quot;<b>5</b>&quot; is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=<span style=\"color:#3333ff;\"><b>4</b></span>).<br/>\nThus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>5</b></span>.
