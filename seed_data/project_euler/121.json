After each turn the disc is returned to the bag, an extra red disc is added, and another disc is taken at random.</p>\n<p>The player pays \u00a31 to play and wins if they have taken more blue discs than red discs at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>If the game is played for four turns, the probability of a player winning is exactly 11/120, and so the maximum prize fund the banker should allocate for winning in this game would be \u00a310 before they would expect to incur a loss. Note that any payout will be a whole number of pounds and also includes the original \u00a31 paid to play the game, so in the example given the player actually wins \u00a39.</p>\n<p>Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated to a single game in which fifteen turns are played.</p>\n</div>"
