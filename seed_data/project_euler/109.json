A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.</p>\n<p>At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.</p>\n<p>There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a \"doubles out\" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is \"bust\".</p>\n<p>When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a \"checkout\" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).</p>\n<p>There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"80\"/><br/>D3</td>\n<td><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"80\"/><br/>\u00a0</td>\n<td><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"80\"/><br/>\u00a0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>D1</td>\n<td>D2</td>\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>S2</td>\n<td>D2</td>\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>D2</td>\n<td>D1</td>\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>S4</td>\n<td>D1</td>\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>S1</td>\n<td>S1</td>\n<td>D2</td>\n</tr><tr><td>S1</td>\n<td>T1</td>\n<td>D1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>S1</td>\n<td>S3</td>\n<td>D1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>D1</td>\n<td>D1</td>\n<td>D1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>D1</td>\n<td>S2</td>\n<td>D1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>S2</td>\n<td>S2</td>\n<td>D1</td>\n</tr></table></div>\n<p>Note that D1 D2 is considered <b>different</b> to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the <b>same</b> as T1 S1 D1.</p>\n<p>In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for example, D3 is the <b>same</b> as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.</p>\n<p>Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.</p>\n<p>How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?</p>\n</div>"
