The two arrangements for N=3 are thus represented as 23 and 29:\n</p><div align=\"center\">00010111\u2009<sub>2</sub> = 23</div>\n<div align=\"center\">00011101\u2009<sub>2</sub> = 29</div>\n<p>Calling S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see that S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52.</p>\n<p>Find S(5).</p>\n</div>"
