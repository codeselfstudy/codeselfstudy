# Code Self Study Website

This is the new [Code Self Study](https://codeselfstudy.com/) website. It's a Gatsby website. There is a Django backend in another repo.

Attend a meetup to find out how to contribute. :construction:

## Goals:

-   help people in the group find something in common to work on
-   meetup activity

### Ideas so far:

-   authenticate with the forum
-   send a coding puzzle of the day into the forum, slack, and/or the browser extension so that interested people have a common task to discuss
-   add new puzzles (links to other sites or original puzzles)
-   mark puzzles that you've completed
-   saving puzzles to do later
-   use the browser extension to add new puzzles to the database?
-   fetch puzzle by difficulty and type of problem
-   commenting? (forum integration or separate)
-   voting

See the [feature board](https://github.com/codeselfstudy/codeselfstudy/projects/1) for more ideas (and add your own).
