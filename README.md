# Code Self Study Website

This is the new [Code Self Study](https://codeselfstudy.com/) website.

Attend a meetup to find out how to contribute. :construction:

## Goals:

- help people in the group find something in common to work on
- meetup activity

### Ideas so far:

- authenticate with the forum
- send a coding puzzle of the day into the forum, slack, and/or the browser extension so that interested people have a common task to discuss
- add new puzzles (links to other sites or original puzzles)
- mark puzzles that you've completed
- saving puzzles to do later
- use the browser extension to add new puzzles to the database?
- fetch puzzle by difficulty and type of problem
- commenting? (forum integration or separate)
- voting

See the [feature board](https://github.com/codeselfstudy/codeselfstudy/projects/1) for more ideas (and add your own).
