The hotel contains an infinite number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.). \n</p><p>\nInitially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> person is assigned a room: person <var>n</var> gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:\n</p><ul><li>the floor is empty</li><li>the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that floor is person <var>m</var>, then <var>m</var> + <var>n</var> is a perfect square</li></ul><p>\nPerson 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.\n<br/>Person 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect square.\n<br/>Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.\n<br/>Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.\n</p><p>\nEventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.\n</p><p>\nDefine P(<var>f</var>, <var>r</var>) to be <var>n</var> if person <var>n</var> occupies room <var>r</var> in floor <var>f</var>, and 0 if no person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:\n<br/>P(1, 1) = 1\n<br/>P(1, 2) = 3\n<br/>P(2, 1) = 2\n<br/>P(10, 20) = 440\n<br/>P(25, 75) = 4863\n<br/>P(99, 100) = 19454\n</p><p>\nFind the sum of all P(<var>f</var>, <var>r</var>) for all positive <var>f</var> and <var>r</var> such that <var>f</var> × <var>r</var> = 71328803586048 and give the last 8 digits as your answer.\n</p>",
