    "body": "<p>If we are presented with the first <var>k</var> terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.</p><p>As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function, <br/><var>u</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> = <var>n</var><sup>3</sup>: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...</p><p>Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that &quot;simple is best&quot; we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.</p><p>We shall define OP(<var>k</var>, <var>n</var>) to be the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first <var>k</var> terms of a sequence. It should be clear that OP(<var>k</var>, <var>n</var>) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for <var>n</var> ≤ <var>k</var>, and potentially the <i>first incorrect term</i> (FIT) will be OP(<var>k</var>, <var>k</var>+1); in which case we shall call it a <i>bad OP</i> (BOP).</p><p>As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for <var>n</var> ≥ 2, OP(1, <var>n</var>) = <var>u</var><sub>1</sub>.</p><p>Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:</p><div style=\"margin-left:50px;\"><table><tr><td>OP(1, <var>n</var>) = 1</td><td>1, <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>1</b></span>, 1, 1, ...</td></tr><tr><td>OP(2, <var>n</var>) = 7<var>n</var>−6</td><td>1, 8, <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>15</b></span>, ...</td></tr><tr><td>OP(3, <var>n</var>) = 6<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>−11<var>n</var>+6     </td><td>1, 8, 27, <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>58</b></span>, ...</td></tr><tr><td>OP(4, <var>n</var>) = <var>n</var><sup>3</sup></td><td>1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...</td></tr></table></div><p>Clearly no BOPs exist for <var>k</var> ≥ 4.</p><p>By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>red</b></span> above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.</p><p>Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><var>u</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> = 1 − <var>n</var> + <var>n</var><sup>2</sup> − <var>n</var><sup>3</sup> + <var>n</var><sup>4</sup> − <var>n</var><sup>5</sup> + <var>n</var><sup>6</sup> − <var>n</var><sup>7</sup> + <var>n</var><sup>8</sup> − <var>n</var><sup>9</sup> + <var>n</var><sup>10</sup></p><p>Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.</p>",
