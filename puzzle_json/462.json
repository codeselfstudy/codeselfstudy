{"title": "Permutation of 3-smooth numbers", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>\nA <b>3-smooth number</b> is an integer which has no prime factor larger than 3. For an integer <var>N</var>, we define S(<var>N</var>) as the set of 3-smooth numbers less than or equal to <var>N</var> . For example, S(20) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18 }.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe define F(<var>N</var>) as the number of permutations of S(<var>N</var>) in which each element comes after all of its proper divisors.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is one of the possible permutations for <var>N</var> = 20.<br/>\n- 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 16, 6, 18, 12.<br/>\nThis is not a valid permutation because 12 comes before its divisor 6.<br/>\n- 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, <b>12</b>, 16, <b>6</b>, 18.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe can verify that F(6) = 5, F(8) = 9, F(20) = 450 and F(1000) \u2248 8.8521816557e21.<br/>\nFind F(10<sup>18</sup>). Give as your answer its scientific notation rounded to ten digits after the decimal point.<br/>\nWhen giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent. E.g. if the answer is 112,233,445,566,778,899 then the answer format would be 1.1223344557e17.\n</p>\n</div>"}
