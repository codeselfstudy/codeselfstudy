{"title": "Selective Amnesia", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>Larry and Robin play a memory game involving of a sequence of random numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time. Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not, the player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number if his memory is full.</p>\n<p>Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which number to remove:<br/>\nLarry's strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the longest time.<br/>\nRobin's strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the longest time.</p>\n<p>Example game:<br/></p><center><table class=\"p298\"><tr><th>Turn</th>\n<th>Called<br/>number</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right;\">Larry's<br/>memory</th>\n<th>Larry's<br/>score</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right;\">Robin's<br/>memory</th>\n<th>Robin's<br/>score</th>\n</tr><tr><td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4,6</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4,6</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4,6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4,6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>6</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4,6,8</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4,6,8</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>7</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">2,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>8</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,6,8,10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">2,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr><tr><td>9</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4,8,10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">2,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr><tr><td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,2,4,8,10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\">1,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr></table></center>\n<p>Denoting Larry's score by <var>L</var> and Robin's score by <var>R</var>, what is the expected value of |<var>L</var>-<var>R</var>| after 50 turns?
