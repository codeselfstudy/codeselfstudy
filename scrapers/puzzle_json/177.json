{"title": "Integer angled Quadrilaterals", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals AC and BD. At each vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides, creating eight corner angles.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:180px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"project/images/p177_quad.gif\"/></p>\n<p>For example, at vertex A, the two angles are CAD, CAB.</p>\n<p>We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have integer values when measured in degrees an \"integer angled quadrilateral\". An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a square, where all eight corner angles are 45\u00b0. Another example is given by DAC = 20\u00b0, BAC = 60\u00b0, ABD = 50\u00b0, CBD = 30\u00b0, BCA = 40\u00b0, DCA = 30\u00b0, CDB = 80\u00b0, ADB = 50\u00b0.</p>\n<p>What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals?</p>\n<p>Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is integral if it is within a tolerance of 10<sup>-9</sup> of an integer value.</p>\n</div>"}
