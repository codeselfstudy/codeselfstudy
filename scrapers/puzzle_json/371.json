{"title": "Licence plates", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>\nOregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit number (each digit can be from [0..9]).<br/>\nWhile driving to work Seth plays the following game:<br/>\nWhenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add to 1000 that's a win.\n</p>\n<p>\nE.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too. (as long as he sees them in the same trip). \n</p><p>\n</p><p>\nFind the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win.<br/>\nGive your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:88%;\">\n<b>Note:</b> We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely to have any three digit number on it.\n</p>\n</div>"}
