Here are some tips on learning how to code for free using online resources.

<h2 class="title is-2">1. Decide on what kinds of things you want to build</h2>

There are many kinds of programming:

<ul>
<li>Do you want to build websites?</li>
<li>If you're building websites, do you want to work on the user interface ("frontend") or the server ("backend")?</li>
<li>Do you want to build mobile apps?</li>
<li>Do you want to program hardware devices or robots?</li>
<li>Create desktop applications?</li>
<li>Study machine learning and data science?</li>
</ul>

If you aren't sure yet, don't worry &mdash; you can skip to the books and courses section below and just start with general basics until you find a specific topic to focus on. You can also ask us specific questions in <a href="https://forum.codeselfstudy.com/">the forum</a>.

<h2 class="title is-2">2. Choose a programming language</h2>

The first programming languages you choose might depend on what you want to build. The table below isn't meant to be comprehensive, but just lists some possible starting points based on your interests.

<strong>Tip:</strong> you can't go wrong by starting
with Python or JavaScript. The things you learn there
will be transferable to other languages.

If the table below doesn't make sense yet and you just
want a recommendation on what language to choose, skip
to the courses section below and start with the free
"CS50" course.
