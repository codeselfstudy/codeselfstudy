This page contains parking information for our regular
events.

<h2 class="title is-2">Tarea Hall Pittman South Branch Library</h2>

For events at the THP Library, there is free parking on the back streets near the library. If you head west on Russell Street for a couple of blocks, you should be able to find free all-day parking. (See the shaded area on the map image below.) There is also free parking to the north and east of the library. Keep an eye out for street sweeping signs, because there are some days when parking isn't allowed in certain areas.

<h2 class="title is-2">Downtown Berkeley</h2>

Parking in Downtown Berkeley can be difficult to find. It's often easier to park at the North Berkeley BART Station (free on Saturdays) and take the BART (or walk) to Downtown Berkeley. You can also park near the THP Library (see above) and take the BART from Ashby station (or walk) to downtown from there.
